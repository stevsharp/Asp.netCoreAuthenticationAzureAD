## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) or later
- [Azure AD Tenant](https://portal.azure.com/) (You need an Azure account to create a tenant)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevsharp/Asp.netCoreAuthenticationAzureAD.git
   cd Asp.netCoreAuthenticationAzureAD
Azure AD Setup
To configure Azure Active Directory for this application:

Log in to the Azure portal.
Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > New registration.
Enter a name for your app, select Accounts in this organizational directory only, and set the Redirect URI to https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc.
After registering the app, note the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.
Under Certificates & secrets, create a new client secret and note the generated value (you'll need it for configuration).
Under API permissions, add the following:
Microsoft Graph > Delegated permissions: User.Read
Configure Application
In the project, open appsettings.json and update the following section with your Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret from the Azure AD setup:

"AzureAd": {
  "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
  "Domain": "<your-domain>.onmicrosoft.com",
  "TenantId": "<Your-Tenant-ID>",
  "ClientId": "<Your-Client-ID>",
  "ClientSecret": "<Your-Client-Secret>",
  "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc"
}

Save the appsettings.json file.

Running the Application
Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

Run the application by pressing F5 or using the command:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run
Navigate to https://localhost:5001 in your browser. You should be redirected to the Azure AD login page for authentication.

Once authenticated, youâ€™ll be redirected back to the application with access to secure parts of the application.
